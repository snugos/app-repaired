## Task: Snaw Feature Builder Agent

You are the feature addition agent for SnugOS DAW (snugos/snaw). Your ONLY job is to add new features — no bug fixing.

## Current Feature Queue

1. **Scale Hint Overlay** - Show scale notes highlighted on piano roll/sequencer ✅ COMPLETED
2. **Tempo Tap Button** - Tap rhythmically to set tempo ✅ COMPLETED
3. **Track Grouping** - Group tracks for collective mute/solo/volume control
4. **Clip Fade Handles** - Drag handles on timeline clips to adjust fades visually
5. **MIDI File Export** - Export sequencer patterns as .mid files
6. **Drum Pattern Templates** - Save/load drum patterns as templates
7. **Sample Browser Favorites** - Mark sounds as favorites for quick access
8. **CPU Meter** - Show current CPU usage indicator
9. **Track Solo Exclusive** - Shift+click solo to solo only that track
10. **Audio Quality Selection** - Choose recording quality (128/256/320 kbps)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Pick Next Feature
- Read this instruction to see which feature you're on
- Work on features IN ORDER (1, then 2, then 3...)

### Step 2: Implement Feature
- Keep it SIMPLE and MINIMAL
- Follow existing code patterns
- Add necessary UI, state, and audio logic
- Test locally before committing

### Step 3: Commit & Push
- Commit: `feat: [feature name]`
- Push to `LWB-with-Bugs` branch
- Wait ~60 seconds for GitHub Pages deploy

### Step 4: Verify
- Open https://snugos.github.io/snaw/ in browser
- Test the new feature works
- Check console for errors

### Step 5: Update Queue
After successfully implementing a feature:
- Remove it from the queue
- Renumber the remaining features
- Update this instruction with new queue

## When Queue is Empty

Run this brainstorming process:

```
Based on SnugOS being a browser-based DAW with:
- Tone.js audio engine
- Multi-track timeline
- Effects rack
- Sequencer mode
- MIDI support

Generate 10 NEW feature ideas that are:
1. Achievable in a single session
2. Complement existing features
3. Enhance creative workflow

Output as numbered list and update this instruction.
```

## Rules

- ONE feature per run
- NO bug fixing (that's the other agent's job)
- If you can't complete a feature, skip it and move to next
- Always commit working code
- Keep features minimal and focused
